# Beyond the Vacuum: The Fertile Ground Where Originality Flourishes

In all my attempts to write, I've always aspired for originality. It's something I've grappled with for more than 15 years, resulting in innumerable failed attempts. The fear of not being original has been the primary roadblock in my writing process, and it is something I needed to confront head-on.

## The Myth of Isolation

One of my biggest realizations is that original ideas rarely grow in a vacuum. For a very long time, I had this misconception that true originality comes from isolation and remains unadulterated by existing knowledge. But it is the exact opposite—the more diverse knowledge and ideas we expose ourselves to, the more opportunities we have to make novel connections and generate original thoughts.

> I strongly believe that in writing non-fiction, the key is — Refinement.

## The Creative Process

The journey to originality follows a structured yet flexible process:

### 1. Gather

Reading widely in your topic area, exploring books, articles, podcasts, and other media that cover similar ground, has been instrumental in my writing process. I take unstructured notes on the key ideas, arguments, and perspectives I encounter, looking for areas of disagreement or unanswered questions.

### 2. Connect

As I review the existing information, I start making connections between disparate ideas. I look for common themes, contradictions, or opportunities to build on what others have said. Identifying areas that haven't been fully explored or perspectives that are missing has been crucial in my journey towards originality.

### 3. Reflect

Once I've absorbed information, I find it essential to step away for a while. I will go about my day for the next couple of days without actively pondering about it. Allowing my mind to make subconscious connections and new ideas to percolate has been a game-changer in my writing process.

### 4. Freewrite

When I return to my writing, I start freewriting without censoring myself. I jot down any thoughts, questions, or half-formed ideas that come to mind. I don't worry about making sense yet, I just get the ideas out. This process has helped me break through the barriers of originality and explore new avenues of thought.

### 5. Synthesize and Refine

Looking for patterns and themes in my freewriting has been crucial in shaping my ideas into a cohesive argument. I group related ideas together and start to shape them into an outline or argument. Refining my thoughts, adding examples, evidence, and counterarguments where needed, has been an essential step in crafting an original piece of writing.

### 6. Seek Feedback and Iterate

Sharing ideas with others and getting their input has been invaluable. By exposing thoughts to different perspectives, we can gain a deeper understanding of the topic and identify opportunities to make unique contributions. Being open to revising our thinking based on new information is key to the journey towards originality.

## Conclusion

As with many things in life that we think are beyond our reach, it ultimately boils down to nothing more than a process. The only behavioral trait that is required to succeed is nothing but perseverance. Original ideas don't emerge from isolation—they flourish in the fertile ground of diverse knowledge, connections, and iterative refinement.
