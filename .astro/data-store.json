It's something I've grappled with for more than 15 years, resulting in innumerable failed attempts. The fear of not being original has been the primary roadblock in my writing process, and it is something I needed to confront head-on.\n\n## The Myth of Isolation\n\nOne of my biggest realizations is that original ideas rarely grow in a vacuum. For a very long time, I had this misconception that true originality comes from isolation and remains unadulterated by existing knowledge. But it is the exact opposite—the more diverse knowledge and ideas we expose ourselves to, the more opportunities we have to make novel connections and generate original thoughts.\n\n> I strongly believe that in writing non-fiction, the key is — Refinement.\n\n## The Creative Process\n\nThe journey to originality follows a structured yet flexible process:\n\n### 1. Gather\n\nReading widely in your topic area, exploring books, articles, podcasts, and other media that cover similar ground, has been instrumental in my writing process. I take unstructured notes on the key ideas, arguments, and perspectives I encounter, looking for areas of disagreement or unanswered questions.\n\n### 2. Connect\n\nAs I review the existing information, I start making connections between disparate ideas. I look for common themes, contradictions, or opportunities to build on what others have said. Identifying areas that haven't been fully explored or perspectives that are missing has been crucial in my journey towards originality.\n\n### 3. Reflect\n\nOnce I've absorbed information, I find it essential to step away for a while. I will go about my day for the next couple of days without actively pondering about it. Allowing my mind to make subconscious connections and new ideas to percolate has been a game-changer in my writing process.\n\n### 4. Freewrite\n\nWhen I return to my writing, I start freewriting without censoring myself. I jot down any thoughts, questions, or half-formed ideas that come to mind. I don't worry about making sense yet, I just get the ideas out. This process has helped me break through the barriers of originality and explore new avenues of thought.\n\n### 5. Synthesize and Refine\n\nLooking for patterns and themes in my freewriting has been crucial in shaping my ideas into a cohesive argument. I group related ideas together and start to shape them into an outline or argument. Refining my thoughts, adding examples, evidence, and counterarguments where needed, has been an essential step in crafting an original piece of writing.\n\n### 6. Seek Feedback and Iterate\n\nSharing ideas with others and getting their input has been invaluable. By exposing thoughts to different perspectives, we can gain a deeper understanding of the topic and identify opportunities to make unique contributions. Being open to revising our thinking based on new information is key to the journey towards originality.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs with many things in life that we think are beyond our reach, it ultimately boils down to nothing more than a process. The only behavioral trait that is required to succeed is nothing but perseverance. Original ideas don't emerge from isolation—they flourish in the fertile ground of diverse knowledge, connections, and iterative refinement.","src/content/blog/beyond-the-vacuum.md",[27],"./beyond-vacuum-hero-wide.png","64eafe0f94612ef0",{"html":30,"metadata":31},"\u003Cp>In all my attempts to write, I’ve always aspired for originality.

Avoid making Statements at all costs.","During my time at Ather Energy as a Product Manager, I found myself in a unique position—mentoring new Product Managers while also managing them. At Ather Energy, senior PMs took on the responsibility of grooming new team members, going beyond mentorship into a more managerial role. It wasn't typical to have IC (Individual Contributor) PM roles; the path for a new PM was through direct guidance from experienced team members.\n\nSometime back, I found these new PMs were finding it difficult to write effective PRDs.

I was working on Data Science & Machine Learning for an Analytics Consulting firm when I got the opportunity to build my first SaaS product, and before I knew it, I was hooked on to the world of building Products & Experiences. But maybe that is a story for a different time. When I started, PM wasn't such a mainstream career choice as it is today. I didn't have an MBA or formal business training; instead, I relied on first principles thinking to solve problems. While it may be a common phrase, it genuinely reflected my approach more because at that time I didn't know much apart from it. I wasn't against frameworks—they're valuable and I picked up some over the years—but I keep going back to my roots in keeping things simple and logical.\n\nAt Ather Energy, one of my responsibilities was to review/edit PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) from the new PMs I managed. These were bright, talented people, but as they were just starting out, their PRDs often needed a lot of editing. I found myself leaving comments on nearly every line. I realized that if my feedback wasn't cohesive — clear, consistent, and structured around key themes — it wouldn't help them grow effectively. It wasn't enough to just make edits; I needed to give them a guiding principle.\n\nAfter a lot of thought, I landed on a simple framework for writing PRDs —\n\n> **Every sentence should either be a Fact or a Hypothesis and absolutely avoid making Statements at all costs.**\n\n**Statements** are risky—they can easily mislead and stick in the minds of readers without evidence to back them up. For example, saying \"Users absolutely hate the current feature\" without any data or context can create a false narrative that influences decisions negatively. It’s our job as PMs to ensure that engineering & design effort isn’t wasted—that what we ask for is based on real customer pain points or a valid, testable hypothesis.\n\n**Facts** should be backed by evidence, and **hypotheses** should come from a well-considered thought process, ideally grounded in some qualitative insights like customer interviews, competitor analysis, or broader industry trends. The key is transparency: if it's a hypothesis, make it clear and explain your reasoning.\n\nInterestingly, a couple of months later, I found my guiding principles validated when I listened to Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, on a podcast with Lex Fridman. He emphasized the importance of distinguishing between facts and opinions —\n\n> \"Every sentence you write in a paper, should be backed by a Citation.\"\n\n...much like the approach I used with my team, showing how this mindset is crucial even in advanced AI research. He talked about similar ideas from his PhD days—how critical it is to distinguish between what you know and what you’re testing.
